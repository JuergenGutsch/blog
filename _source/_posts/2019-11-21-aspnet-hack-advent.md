During this years Advent, I'd like to post a kind of an Advent calendar. Until December 24th I'm going to post a link to a good community resource and a few lines about it. The resource should be about ASP.NET Core, .NET Core or C# or a related topic. This resource might be a blog post, a useful open source software or a video. It shouldn't be a commercial. It also should be as new as possible. Maybe not older than two months. None of the linked resources will be created by me.

You got the idea?

I'm going to push the Advent calendar posts every day via twitter and I will list them here in this introduction post:

- #01: [NDC Conference Videos]({% post_url advent-post-ndc-conferences.md %})
- #02: [Steve Gordon's blog]({% post_url advent-post-steve-gordon.md %})
- #03: [Fritz and Friends]({% post_url advent-post-fritz-and-friends.md %})
- #04: [Damien Bowden's blog]({% post_url advent-post-damien-bowden.md %})
- #05: [.NET Core 3.1 is out]({% post_url advent-post-dotnet31.md %})
- #06: [Andrew Lock's blog]({% post_url advent-post-andrew-lock.md %})
- #07: [Blazorise]({% post_url advent-post-blazorise.md %})
- #08: [Hanselman debugs a .NET Core Linux app in WSL2 with VS on Windows]({% post_url advent-post-netcore-wsl-debug-linux.md %})
- #09: [November 2019 .NET/ASP.NET Documentation Update]({% post_url advent-post-core-docs-update.md %})
- #10: [Wasmtime]({% post_url advent-post-wasmtime.md %})
- #11: 
- #12:

Until yet, I've just a few ideas which resources I'm going to write about. So you are free to propose some nice and useful links in the comments below.
