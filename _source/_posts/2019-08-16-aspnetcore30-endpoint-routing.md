The last two posts were just a quick look into the `Program.cs` and the `Startup.cs`. This time I want to have a little deeper look into the new endpoint routing.

**Wait!**

Sometimes I have an Idea about a specific topic to write about and start writing. While writing I'm remembering that I maybe already wrote about it. Than I take a look into the blog archive and there it is:

[Implement Middlewares using Endpoint Routing in ASP.NET Core 3.0](https://asp.net-hacker.rocks/2019/04/10/routed-middlewares.html)

Maybe I get old now... ;-)

This is why I just link to the already existing post.

Anyways. The next two posts are a quick glimpse into Blazor Server Side and Blazor Client Side. 

**Why?** Because I also want to focus on the different Hosting models and Blazor Client Side is using a different one.
