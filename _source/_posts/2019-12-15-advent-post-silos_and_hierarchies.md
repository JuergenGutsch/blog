This post is a special one. Not really related to .NET Core or ASP.NET Core, but to software development in general. I recently stumbled upon this post and while reading it I found myself remembering the days back when I needed to write code others estimated and specified for me.

The woman who wrote this post lives in Cologne Germany and worked in really special environments, like self organizing teams and companies. I met Krisztina Hirth several times at community events in Germany. I really like her ideas, the way she thinks and the way she writes. You should definitely also read her other posts on her blog: [https://yellow-brick-code.org/](https://yellow-brick-code.org/)
