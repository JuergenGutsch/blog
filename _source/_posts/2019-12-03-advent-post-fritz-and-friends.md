Twitch isn't just for gamers and folks who wants to watch gamers playing games. There are also a lot of developers who do life coding on Twitch. And the guy who does this for a long time (since almost forever) is Jeff Fritz. 

Jeff is a Program Manager for Microsoft on the ASP.NET and .NET Community Outreach teams and he was responsible for ASP.NET Web Forms and WCF in the past. 

Several times a week he starts a really entertaining live stream on Twitch you should definitely watch. During the live stream you are able to directly interact with him and the with the rest of the audience. This is definitely a fun show that also contains a lot of things to learn.
