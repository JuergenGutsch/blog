Stephen Toub published two really good blog post about in the Microsoft .NET Net blog. 

The first one is a really good and detailed FAQ style post about ConfigureAwait. If you would like to learn about ConfigureAwait, you should read it:

[ConfigureAwait FAQ](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/configureawait-faq/)

The second one is an introduction into System.Threading.Channels. This post is really good introduction and goes more and mote deep into that topic:
