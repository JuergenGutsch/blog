The [.NET Conf](https://www.dotnetconf.net/) in September this year was great and it was a pleasure to also do a talk on the 25th which was the community cay with a lot of awesome talks from community folks around the world. I'm really looking forward to the next one and hope I can do another talk next year.

Yesterday I was surprised when I stumbled upon the announcement about another special .NET Conf that is scheduled for January 14th. This is really a special one with the focus on Blazor:

The schedule isn't online yet, but will be there soon, as they wrote.

I like the idea to have special focused .NET Confs. The infrastructure with the Channel9 studios already is available, so it is cheap to setup a virtual conference like this. And I can imagine a few more topics to focus on:

* Entity Framework Core
* ASP.NET Core
* Async/Await
* Desktop
* And maybe a MVP driven .NET Conf during the MVP Summit 2020 in March ;-)
