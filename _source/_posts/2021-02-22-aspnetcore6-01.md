.NET 5 was released just about 3 months age and [Microsoft announced the first preview of .NET 6](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6-preview-1/) last week. This is really fast. Actually, they already started working on .NET 6 before version 5 was released. But it is anyway cool to have a preview available to start playing around. Also, the ASP.NET team wrote a new blog post. It is [about ASP.NET Core updates on .NET 6](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-6-preview-1/).

I will take the chance to have a more detailed look into the updates and the new feature. I'm going to start a series about those updates and features. This is also a chance to learn what I need to rewrite, If I need to update [my book that recently got published]({% post_url my-book.md %}) by Packt.

## Install .NET 6 preview

At first I'm going to download ..NET 6 preview from [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) and  install it on my machine.

I chose the x64 Installer for Windows and started the installation

![install01.png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/aspnetcore6/install01.png)

After the installation is done the new SDK is available. Type dotnet --info in a terminal:

![dotnetinfo.png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/aspnetcore6/dotnetinfo.png)

## Be careful

Since I didn't add a `global.json` yet, the .NET 6 preview is the default SDK. This means I need to be careful if I want to create a .NET 5 project. I need to add a `global.json` every time I want to create a .NET 5 project:

```shell
dotnet new globaljson --sdk-version 5.0.103
```

This creates a small JSON file that contains the SDK version number in the current folder.

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "5.0.103"
  }
}
```

Now all folder and subfolder will use this SDK version.
