Do you like podcasts? Do you like entertaining and funny technical podcasts about .NET?  I definitely do. I like to listen to them while commuting. The best and (I guess) the most famous .NET related podcast is .NET Rocks:

[Carl Franklin](https://twitter.com/carlfranklin) and [Richard Campbell](https://twitter.com/richcampbell) really do a great show, they invite a lot of cool and well known experts to their shows and discuss about cutting-edge topics around .NET and Microsoft technologies.
