Ok, this is not one of the posts I expected to write for the ASP.NET Hack Advent, but it is an important one anyway and not that off-topic. 

On Monday .NET Core 3.1 was released, which is a release for long term support (LTS). This release is full of bugfixes and and housekeeping. On the ASP.NET Core side it brings a lot of new improvements for Blazor as well as it now supports .NET Standard 2.1
