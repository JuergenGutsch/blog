Recently I stumbled upon a really cool project that provides frontend components for Blazor. It supports Blazor server side and Blazor WebAssembly on the client side. I found that project, while I was searching for a chart component for a Blazor demo application I'm currently working on.

This project is called Blazorise, is completely open source and hosted on GitHub. It is built on top of Blazor and CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Material and Bulma. (Actually I've never heard about Bulma.)

Blazorise contains a lot of useful components, including a library to create Charts and DataGrids. It is actively maintained, well documented and also has demo pages for all three CSS Framework implementations.

If you are working with Blazor, you should have a look at it:
