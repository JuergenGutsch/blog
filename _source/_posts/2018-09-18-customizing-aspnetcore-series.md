With this post I want to introduce a new blog series about things you can or maybe need to customize in ASP.NET Core. Initially this series will contain ten different topics. Maybe later I'll write some more posts about that.

The initial topics are based on my talk about [Customizing ASP.NET Core](https://sessionize.com/s/juergengutsch/customizing_aspnet_core/19237). I did this talk several times in German and English. I did the talk on the [.NET Conf 2018](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf/2018/S306) as well. 

> Unfortunately on the .NET Conf the talk started with pretty bad audio for some reasons. The first five minutes can be moved directly to the trash IMHO. I also could only show 7 out of 10 demos, even if I tried to get all the demos into 45 minutes one day before. I'm almost sure the audio problem wasn't on my side. Via the router I disconnected almost all devices from the internet during the our I was presenting  and it went well before the presentation when we did the latest tech check.

> Anyway, after five minutes the audio went a lot better and the audience was able to follow the rest of the presentation.

For this series I'm going to follow the same order as in that presentation, which is the order from bottom to top, from the server configuration parts, over Web.API up to the MVC topics.
