My fellow MVP and Author Valerio De Sanctis published a new book. I was already honored [by technical reviewing his book](aspnetcore-angular-review.md) about "ASP.NET Core 2 and Angular 5" a couple of years ago.

His new book is highlighting the ASP.NET Core Web API and got published on Manning Publications.
