For the todays ASP.NET Hack Advent post, I found a link to one of the awesome posts of [Filip W](http://twitter.com/filip_woj). In this post Filip describes the new project type that allows you to write .NET Projects in IL code directly. He writes how to create a new `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.IL` project and how to write IL code. He also answered the most important question about why you might need to write IL code directly.
